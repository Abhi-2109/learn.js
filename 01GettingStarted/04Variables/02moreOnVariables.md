# Constants  

Constant variables are those variables whose value will not be changed in future.  
For example : your enrollment number will never be changed once allocated.  

### Naming Constants  

Constants are always named using uppercase letters. For example :

```javascript
let ENROLL = 0103CS16
```  
# Datatypes

JavaScript is dynamically typed scripting language. That is, in javascript variables can receive different data types over the time. Datatypes are basically type of data that can be used and manipulated in a program.

JavaScript supports 3 primitive datatypes: 
  * Numbers: 1, 2.5, 3 etc.  
  * String: “Hello World” etc.  
  * Boolean: true, false.  

Except for the above three primitive data types, JavaScript also supports two trivial datatypes null and undefined and one composite datatype object.
