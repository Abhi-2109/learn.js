# Learn Javascript  

So, let's start learning Javascript together. Together we can achieve our goal very fastly. Contributions are always welcomed.  

Each part in the js series will contain *article.md* file, which will give some introduction about the topic. So, go through that article first.  

Some basic examples are added for each topic to make the topic more clear(More examples coming soon).     

## What is Javascript?

*JavaScript* is the Programming Language for the Web.  
  
*JavaScript* can update and change both HTML and CSS.  
  
*JavaScript* can calculate, manipulate and validate data.  

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in the HTML and executed automatically as the page loads.  

Scripts are provided and executed as a plain text. They don't need a special preparation or a compilation to run.  

*JavaScript* is a programming language that started off simply as a mechanism to add logic and interactivity to an otherwise static Netscape browser. In the years since its introduction, it has not only supplanted a variety of other competing languages and technologies to become the standard for browser-based programming, but it has also expanded beyond the client space to become a dominant language on the server side, as well.  

## Any Prerequisites for learning Javascript?  

Basic knowledge of any programming language is the only prerequisites of learning JavaScript. But some basic knowledge of the following will help you to move faster with javascript :  

  * Basic knowledge of Java or any programming language.  
  * Basic knowledge of HTML.  
  
## JavaScript : The Awesome Script  

JavaScript has stormed the web technology and nowadays small software ventures to fortune 500, all are using node js for web apps. Recently wordpress.com has rewritten its dashboard in javascript, paypal also chose to rewrite some of its components in java script. Be it google/twitter/facebook, javascript is important for everyone. It is used in applications like single page applications, Geolocation APIs, net advertisements etc.  

However JavaScript is quirky/dynamic/scripting/ functional oriented language, and it has its own idiosyncrasies. It is not scalable, it is good for some 3000 line of code but for a bigger app, it becomes difficult to manage ,read and debug. Also not everyone is very much familiar to JavaScript.  

You might sometimes think that, I do not know much of a JavaScript then “How to be JavaScript Developer without much knowledge of JavaScript?”  

To ease down our work, some smart developers/companies have made compiler/transpiler which convert your other language code into javascript code.(Best of both worlds)  

  * **C++** : If you know C++, then it is possible to get it converted into JavaScript. [Cheerp](https://leaningtech.com/cheerp/ "Cheerp") is a free compiler for open source commercial projects as well as for closed source non commercial projects.It is the C++ compiler for the web.You just write a web application or port your existing one, all in C++. Cheerp will generate its JavaScript code that can run on any browser.  
  * **Java** : Java is a darling of open source, backed by Oracle/IBM/Google/Red hat. Maximum number of developers in the world are Java developers(around 10 millions). Maximum number of projects in github and apache are based on Java.  
    * [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/overview.html) is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based application.  
Its goal is to enable productive development of high-performance web applications without the developer having to be an expert in browser quirks, XMLHttpRequest, and JavaScript. It’s open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world.  
    * [JSweet](http://www.jsweet.org/) is a transpiler from Java to TypeScript/JavaScript It contains 1000+ well-typed JavaScript libraries available from Java.  
    * [Kotin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code. Unlike most programming languages, Kotlin language is not made by Academia or Research Lab but it is made by a professional company jetbrains.  
    
  * **Scala** : Mix of object oriented and functional approach. It is a static language, but can be use as a dynamic language. Many big enterprises like LinkedIn, Twitter are written in Scala. Again, you write code in scala and [scala-js](http://www.scala-js.org/ "scala-js") comes to rescue and code gets compiled/transpiled into javascript.  
  * **c#** : Beautiful and most productive language. Now a days, it is much like scala language, specially after version 4.0. You can write your code in C# and convert into javascript using [bridge.net](https://bridge.net/ "bridge.net").  
  * **Typescript** : Brain Child of Anders Hejlsberg, who made Turbo, Pascal, Delphi, C# language. TypeScript lets you write JavaScript the way you really want to. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open Source.
