## What is Javascript?


*JavaScript* is the Programming Language for the Web  
  
*JavaScript* can update and change both HTML and CSS  
  
*JavaScript* can calculate, manipulate and validate data  

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in the HTML and executed automatically as the page loads.  

Scripts are provided and executed as a plain text. They don't need a special preparation or a compilation to run.
