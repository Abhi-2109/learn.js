# How to find error ?  
We know that javascript directly runs on browser. But in the browser, a user doesn't see the errors by default. So, if something goes wrong in the script, we won't see what's broken and can't fix it.  
What to do in these situataion ?  
Don't worry! every browser has *Developer Tools*.  
## What are Developer Tools ?  
*Developer Tools* help you to find and fix issues in layouts and functionality you may find across browsers. For instance, if a button isn’t working or an image in the layout isn’t in the right place, these tools help you resolve those issues. These tools are shipped along with the browser. If they aren’t, install them.  
## Where to find Developer Tools ?  
*Developer Tools* come with every browser. You can press *F12* to open *Developer Tools*.   
Go on *console* and find the error in code. Other options are also available. Try to explore them.   
(Almost every browser's developer tools can be opened by *F12*. If you are not getting it by pressing *F12* then find how to install Dev tools in your particular browser.)
